# Linux Build 2021
For Building Linux laptops (ubuntu) and hardening to CIS standards
### This is very much a work in progress and should be treated as such. 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to aid with the build of ubuntu based machines.
I have tried to make this as user friendly as possible, hence the menu options for example, if you needed to just join the machine to the domain, you have that option.

### Operating system support
Supported/Tested:
Ubuntu 20.10

## How to run
1) Clone this Git repo to a file on the local machine
2) Make shell scripts executable 
3) Launch the run.sh file to bring up the diaglog / option menu
